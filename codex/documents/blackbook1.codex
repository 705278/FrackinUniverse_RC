"We stumbled across the strange pit quite accidentally. At first, Meekip was terrified. He kept babbling about some sort of weird things he claimed lived beneath the surface. Of course, he warmed up to the idea when we mentioned the funding we could secure.",
"Down nine flights of seemingly endless stairs we travelled, through ancient tunnels and causeways unseen for millenia. The smell of decay was rich in the air, though we could not ascertain where the stench was coming from. We pressed on, hoping that it would relent.",
"After more than two hours of walking through those dark catacombs, we found what we had sought: The altar. It wasn't just myth. It stood there, defiant of time and space, daring us to approach. Meekip ran, then, but perhaps it was for the best. He was doomed anyway.",
"The altar whispered to me, dark secrets and reality-shattering revelations. I heard Meekip scream from down the corrider from whence we had come. It was wet, sloshing and repulsive beyond description. And then...silence. It was mine. All mine.",
