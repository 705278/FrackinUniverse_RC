"We stumbled across the strange pit quite accidentally. At first, Meekip was terrified. He kept babbling about some sort of weird things he claimed lived beneath the surface. Of course, he warmed up to the idea when I mentioned the funding we could secure.",
"Down nine flights of seemingly endless stairs we travelled, through ancient tunnels and causeways unseen for millenia. The smell of decay was rich in the air, though we could not ascertain where the stench was coming from. Verdigris of some sort, or some long-dead mummified being was the most likely explanation. We pressed on, hoping that it would relent.",
"After more than two hours of walking through those dark catacombs, we found what we had sought. Thousands of odd artifacts, technological and otherwise littered the level we had just reached.",
"We collected several samples as well as a number of the artifacts, which we placed in a storage container for travel back to home base. That was when we first heard it...",
"Something made a guttural screech within the maze of passageways, followed by several answering calls. Scared, we began towards the exit from whence we had come.",
"Oddly, our own instruments misled us. The way was blocked, despite being certain that exit had been our entrance in the first place. We had no choice but to change course and head eastward instead.",
"More screeches sounded, and then some sort of hideous slopping, as of vomit onto concrete. And then, footsteps. Thousands of them. We ran, then. I am ashamed to say that Meekip lost pace and I dared not turn back for him.",
"Soon I was totally lost, and the battery for my ion torch was nearing its end. I was resigned to the fact that whatever was lurking in the tunnels would soon have me. That was when I saw the light...or something resembling light, at least.",
"I followed the source of this light, and found myself in a massive chamber. The sheer scope of it beggared belief. It was as if a God had fashioned it, though what sort of God could build at such bizarre dimensions...",
"In the center of this monolithic chamber stoof a single object. An altar. It stood there, defiant of time and space, daring me to approach. I resist even now, and write this so that whoever finds this place knows...leave at once. Do not look back.",
"The altar whispers to me, dark secrets and reality-shattering revelations. I heard Meekip scream not long ago, and the slopping sound accompanied it. It was wet, sloshing and repulsive beyond description. And then...silence.",
"I found a way to bar the door, though I know not how well, nor how long, it shall hold off whatever approaches now. May the finder of this journal heed my words: Do not seek out the mysteries of the Precursors. They are not what we thought.",
